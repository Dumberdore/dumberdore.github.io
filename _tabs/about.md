## _Hey  there!_  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dumberdore/dumberdore.github.io/main/assets/img/wave.gif" width="30">


I am Prakash, an **Engineering Manager** @[Wesco](https://wesco.com).

I enjoy programming in Go & Python! In previous jobs, I have worked with C/C++, Hack, and various scripting languages.
Before joining Wesco, I have been a Software Developer, Test Automation Engineer, and Lecturer.

Alongside tech, I have been moonlighting as a Poker Player and an amateur photographer.

Cheers! üçª
