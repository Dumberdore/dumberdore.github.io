## _Hey  there!_  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dumberdore/dumberdore.github.io/main/assets/img/wave.gif" width="30" alt="Waving Hand">


I am Prakash, a **staff engineer** @[_Teckro_](https://teckro.com).

I enjoy programming in `Go` & `Python`! In previous jobs, I have worked with C/C++, Hack, and various scripting languages.
`DevOps` it my area of specialisation with expertise in Container Orchestration, CI/CD, SRE and so on!

Before joining **Wesco**, I have been a Software Developer, Test Automation Engineer, and Lecturer.

Alongside tech, I have been moonlighting as a Poker Player and an amateur photographer.<br>
Cheers! 🍻
